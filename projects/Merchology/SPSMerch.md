### Project Overview

SPS required a custom Shopify store to handle employee orders for branded merchandise, with global markets and delivery. As the lead developer on this project, I was responsible for building, configuring, maintaining and directing development of the site from its initial setup through post-launch debugging.

This was a challenging project for Merchology, involving tight timelines, changing requirements, and requested features new to the company.

### My Roles & Responsibilities

- Built and maintained the Shopify storefront for SPS.  
- Worked directly with Merchology’s internal teams and client contacts to troubleshoot and deploy fixes.  
- Managed the integration and testing process before and after launch.  
- Provided technical support and clear communication to resolve launch confusion.  
- Identified, diagnosed, and resolved a critical shipping bug that interfered with FedEx rate display.

### Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** Confusion Around Launch  

The SPS site launch was initially misaligned between Merchology’s internal teams and the client’s expectations. The store was pushed live before all contract discussions had been completed, leading to skepticism around the sites capabilities.  

**Solution:** I stepped in to coordinate communications across teams and clarify the deployment status. I verified key functionality, ran further internal testing, reported partial outage impact scale and stood on-call to make urgent changes. Through consistent investigation and troubleshooting, I was able to assist the sales team in regaining the clients trust.

**Challenge:** Shipping Bug with FedEx  

Shortly after launch, the SPS team noticed that some users were unable to check out. FedEx shipping rates weren’t populating for some international customers. 

**Solution:** The first step I took in solving this problem was assessing the impact. I found that several counties were failing to receiving shipping rates. I reported this back to the client so they were aware of the impact scale. I continued by verifying our shipping settings and reproduced the bug on a different store. I noticed that Shopify had recently updated their api connection to the new version of the FedEx api. I interfaced with both Shopify and FedEx support, obtaining information for both sides. After several hours of working with both support agents, I convinced the Shopify support agent that the issue was on their end. He agreed to push this issue to their development team. The development team confirmed this was an issue with their implementation. I monitored their work on fixing the bug for the next three weeks. When the bug was fixed, I retested and confirmed it was working on my end. I then contact the project team and updated the client on the now working status of international shipping.

### Results & Impact

The SPS custom site was successfully launched and has remained stable since. Despite early confusion and technical setbacks, the project became a model for how Merchology’s development team could manage and recover from live deployment issues under pressure.

Through this project we:  
- Delivered a fully functional Shopify site with custom configuration for the SPS client.  
- Resolved a critical carrier integration bug with FedEx that had blocked order processing.  
- Improved internal communication and coordination around launch workflows.  
- Demonstrated resilience and adaptability in a live environment.

### Reflection

This project tested not just technical skill but operational composure. Between an early launch and a critical bug, the SPS site required fast thinking, clear communication, and methodical debugging. By staying calm and transparent, I turned a chaotic rollout into a smooth-running system that continues to serve the client successfully today.

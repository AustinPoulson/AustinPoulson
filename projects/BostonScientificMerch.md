### Project Overview

Boston Scientific needed a centralized platform for employees to order branded merchandise while maintaining brand integrity. As a developer at Merchology, my role was to convert their Figma design into a fully functional Shopify-powered online merch store.

### My Roles & Resposibilities

- Implementing the design into a functioning website.
- Ownership of the Shopify store.
- Consultation on the technical capabilities of the platform.
- Understanding customer use-cases and implementing custom solutions.

The project went through several iterations during the initial development phase. 

Final Implementation:
